A passionate technology professional and entrepreneur. I have over 12 years experience in Java development covering multiple technologies... 

Some of my thoughts about writing code and building software:

<p class="message">
  Software expenses: 10% to build - 90% to support and evolution. Do your best when you are building
</p>

<p class="message">
  A good code is like a good book: funny and easy to read
</p>

<p class="message">
  There are a lot of people knowing programming languages. There are less people knowing how to write a good code. There are many less people knowing how to build software. And then, there are people that imagine software and the new Internet possibilities
</p>
